# Gas Saving Techniques
This repository is mainly to test any gas saving technique we see or here about to know how much gas we really save to know whether it is effective.

    for.sol - contains gas optimization techniques for for loop

    require.sol - contains gas optimization techniques for handling reverts i.e require & custom reverts

    return.sol - checks how much gas spent with the way we return valies in function calls

    variables.sol - checks how much gas the various initialization of variables coding styles cost

# Credits
1. All the twitter accounts that tweet about Gas
2. https://github.com/devanshbatham/Solidity-Gas-Optimization-Tips - inspired the bitwise.sol, swap.sol, 4th and 5th function of for.sol.
